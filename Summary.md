# Scope of Influence

The scope of influence that a person has on their work, their team, the company, and the industry. 
A very skilled engineer will likely have influence over a whole project, or area, and having wider influence requires deeper skill. Someone earlier in their journey may influence only the tasks they work on directly.

# Ownership

The ownership that they have over their area.
The amount of ownership is how we attribute the level of responsibility that a person has within the team.

# Levels

## Level I
**Scope of Influence**: Themselves and their tasks

**Ownership**: No ownership responsibility. Learning and being actively developed by others

**Summary**: Expected to drive results with some support. They have experience in the role, can take responsibility, but are still learning the job and will have questions and need support. They can execute the tactical plan for a project but typically can’t make it.

## Level II

**Scope of Influence**: Their projects and pace

**Ownership**: Fully owns an area, channel, or discipline. Accountable for deliverables in that area.

**Summary**: Progress beyond 1 but not quite to 3

## Level III

**Scope of Influence**: Their area and strategy

**Ownership**: Consistent record of very strong ownership for their area. Accountable for results in that area. 

**Summary**: Expected to drive results with little or no supervision** (“set and forget”). These folks know how to do the job. They can make a project’s tactical plan. They can work across the organization to get it done.

## Level IV

**Scope of Influence**: Whole organization

**Ownership**: Exhibits ownership across the team, as it relates to the impact of their area. Accountable for executing on their area’s strategy.

**Summary**: Progress beyond 3 but not quite to 5

## Level V

**Scope of Influence**: Industry

**Ownership**: Fully responsible for all aspects of their area. 
This takes an exceptional level of dedication to the craft and is a big jump from Level 4

**Summary**: Expected to make the plan. Your job is to understand the company’s business situation, understanding the marketing vision and goals, make a plan to address it, build consensus and get approval for that plan, then go execute it.
